    <h1>About Hot Potatoes</h1>
    </div>


    <p>It all started with a lonely spud and a dream.</p>

    <p>Weâ€™re not your average farm-to-table restaurant â€” weâ€™re farm-to-fork-to-face, with a single-minded mission:</p>

    <p><strong>ðŸ”¥ Make the world love potatoes as much as we do.</strong></p>

    <p>Born in a tiny kitchen with a big bag of Yukon Golds, Hot Potatoes has grown into a celebration of</p>
    <p><strong>all things crispy, creamy, buttery, and beautiful.</strong> </p>

    <p>Weâ€™ve got no beef. Just taters.</p>

    <p>Our team? A band of self-proclaimed starchivists </p>
    <p>â€” committed to crafting the perfect potato dish for every craving, every mood, and every holiday (yes, even Arbor Day).</p>

    <p>So whether you're a fries fanatic, a mash master, or just here for the novelty â€” we welcome you with open arms and open ovens.</p>

    <p><strong>ðŸ¥” Hot Potatoes: We didnâ€™t choose the spud life. The spud life chose us.</strong></p>
